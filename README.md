---
### Getting Started

- Welcome! Take a deep breath and work through each step by reading the details carefully. Work through as many steps as possible. Show your ability to seek out information and apply knowledge. It's not quantity, it's effort!

- Use the code base provided in the [index.html of the It Center of Excellence Mini Project Repository](https://github.com/itcenterofexcellence/miniproject/blob/master/index.html) and *use resources available through searching the Internet* to create and host on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) **your own Cleveland Codes Applicant To Do List**

- [View an example GitHub hosted page](https://itcenterofexcellence.github.io/miniproject/)

- You can use a text editor like [NotePad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) to make changes to the code, then save it as an index.html file, and drag it into an open internet browser (ex. Google Chrome) to view your changes

- **_Note: You do not need to download the desktop version of GitHub, all of the work for this project can be completed by using [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) in your browser_**

### Your Tasks

Implement the following changes to the code found in the index.html file:

1. Change the headline from "Cleveland Codes Applicant To Do List" to "Your Name Applicant To Do List" ex. *Taylor Cuyahoga's To Do List"*

2. Change the placeholder text from "Add a task" to "Your First Name's tasks" ex. *Taylor's tasks*

3. You can "style" a webpage with CSS. Add a background image to the header area of the page [You can find hosted image resources here](https://github.com/ravisuhag/stockfree) and [here.](https://www.pexels.com/)

4. When you mouse or "hover" over the button it changes color. Using CSS change the button hover color from gray to a color of your choice.

5. Add a sans serif font family to the webpage body text using CSS 

6. Add a link to the *"Update Resume"* list item that links to your updated resume hosted online. [You can find free .PDF hosting sites here.](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/7-best-tools-present-share-pdf-files-online/) *For example, you can upload a PDF to Google Drive and share the document to get a link for your code.*

7. Add a link to the *"Practice for My Interview"* list item that links to a YouTube video with the title "CS50 and Quora present... Prep and Practice for Technical Interviews"

8. Add a border radius to the list close button so that on hover the box turns into a circle ![alt text](https://s7.postimg.org/c70shqhcb/box.png "box.")

9. Add a JavaScript alert pop up so that when you click the **X** to delete a task, a pop message says *"Are you sure you want to delete this task?"*

10. Create a READ ME file in your own GitHub project repository. Use this to document the steps you took, any challenges, and the resources you utilized to complete your project
